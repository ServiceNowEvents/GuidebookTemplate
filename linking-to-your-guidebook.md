## Sharing links

We would love your lab Powerpoint presentation to have a couple of consistent elements, to keep your lab attendees following along.

These elements are: **a QR code for your guidebook on your PPT title slide, and including your lab instance link in the slide footers.**&#x20;

&#x20;

1. &#x20;In your Powerpoint template, go to the ribbon bar > insert tab, and click Get Add-ins.
2.

    <div align="left">

    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-23 at 12.19.16 PM.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    </div>
3. A pop-up window should appear. Search "QR Code" and you should see the appropriate add-in.
4.

    <div align="left">

    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-23 at 12.22.17 PM.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    </div>
5. Add this to your PowerPoint tools.
6. On slide three of the official Knowledge 2024 Lab template, use the QR code generator to convert your guidebook url to a QR code.
7. Move the generated code image to the right hand side, example below:
8.

    <div align="left">

    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-23 at 12.28.08 PM.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption><p>Image of a powerpoint title slide</p></figcaption></figure>

    </div>

**The template is also formated with footers for your lab instance url, which you can add once the instance is spun up for you.**
