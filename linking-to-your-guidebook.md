  We would love your lab Powerpoint presentation to have a couple of consistent
  elements, to keep your lab attendees following along.

# Exercise 4: Presenting

These elements are: **a QR code for your guidebook on your PPT title slide, and including your lab instance link in the slide footers.**&#x20;

**For the QR code:** In your Powerpoint template, go to the ribbon bar > insert tab, and click Get Add-ins:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-23 at 12.19.16 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A pop-up window should aappear. Search "QR Code" and you should see the appropriate add-in:

Add this to your PowerPoint tools. On slide three of the official Knowledge 2024 Lab template, use the QR code generator to convert your guidebook url to a QR code. Move the generated code image to the right hand side, example below:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-23 at 12.28.08 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**The template is also formated with footers for your lab instance url, which you can add once the instance is spun up for you.**
