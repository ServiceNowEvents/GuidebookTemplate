## Sharing links

We would love your lab Powerpoint presentation to have a couple of consistent elements, to keep your lab attendees following along.

These elements are: **a QR code for your guidebook on your PPT title slide, and including your lab instance link in the slide footers.**&#x20;

&#x20;

1. &#x20;In your Powerpoint template, go to the ribbon bar > insert tab, and click Get Add-ins.<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt="" data-size="original">
2.  A pop-up window should appear. Search "QR Code" and you should see the appropriate add-in.

    <div align="left">

    <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Image of PowerPoint Add-ins pop up window</p></figcaption></figure>

    </div>
3. Add this to your PowerPoint tools.
4. On slide three of the official Knowledge 2024 Lab template, use the QR code generator to convert your guidebook url to a QR code.
5. Move the generated code image to the right hand side, example below:![](<.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)

**The template is also formated with footers for your lab instance url, which you can add once the instance is spun up for you.**
