# Guidebook Formatting Basics
## Lab Goal
Explain the purpose and objective of each section in this area.
Break labs into groups of related activities and steps.

Examples: 
* Lab 1 – Create Tables,
* Lab 2 – Create Access Request Fields
* Lab 3 – Create Entitlement Fields

Use Heading 1/H1 _only_ for lab titles.  All content under H1 will render as a single page when digital guidebooks are published.

## Lab Sections
The Heading 2/H2 marker will be used to generate the navigation/table of contents within each lab module.

# Markdown Tips & Tricks
## General Formatting Guide
We're using GitHub not just to store/version guidebooks, but also to render to HTML.  See [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for an introduction to standard formatting.

Beyond standard Markdown, we have a few conventions you need to follow for your guidebook to render properly

## H1 & H2 relationship
Always follow your H1 lab title immediately with an H2 section title.  This is a convention we're using to automatically generate the table of contents and navigation.

## Lists
While Markdown supports nesting ordered and un-ordered lists, please avoid using nested lists in your guide book.  This is to avoid conflicts with how we style (or rather, don't) nested lists on the Developer Portal.

1. Use numbered lists for task steps
1. You don't have to manually number each step

    But sometimes you need paragraphs between steps.  In those cases, indent your paragraphs with a tab.

    Multiple paragraphs are OK too.

1. And markdown will pick up numbering where you left off.
