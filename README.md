# Getting started

This template has our best practices, tips & tricks for building a CreatorCon/Knowledge lab guide. To help show you how to format your lab, we've built the template in for format of a lab guide. As you build, feel free to delete these pages or rename them and substitute your content for ours. The original [Guidebook Template](https://app.gitbook.com/o/wXJhB7H8YqI7f2lOgBuI/s/c7GjOdeQ7mwmcuwx8tIn/) will always be available.&#x20;

For your lab, a Getting started section is used for pre-work instructions such as downloading files used in the lab, installing applications, or creating web service credentials. If no pre work is required and someone can log into their instance and jump straight into the exercise, you can omit this section.
