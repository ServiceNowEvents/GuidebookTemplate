# Exercise 3: Recording

## Goal

Align your presentation with your guidebook.

## Presenting

When recording the video presentation for the on-demand version of your lab, you won't be walking through the entire lab step by step. After introducing yourself and setting up what the lab is about, you'll give a brief talk about what to expect in each section of the lab (goals, gotchas, things to watch out for...etc.), the attendee will pause the video, complete that section of the guidebook and then come back to the video.

To make it easier for the viewers to scrub to the appropriate section of the video (as well as the video editors), you'll need to create a slide in your presentation deck for each section in the guidebook. For example, for this guidebook, there would be six section titles slides with text that match each Page in the GitBook guide:

* Getting started
* Exercise 1: Pages and formatting
* Exercise 2: Writing style
* Exercise 3: Recording
* Exercise 4: Presenting
* Challenge: Hand-coded Markdown

Using the "Section\_Slide\_Dark" layout from the presentation template, each of your slides should look like this

You may optionally include any other slides you need to setup the exercise between these section title slides, but the section title slide is mandatory.
