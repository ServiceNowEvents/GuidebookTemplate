# Lab Checklist

## Components 
- [ ] Session Outline/Abstract
	- [ ] Outline should be "Section + Goal"
		- ex: "Section 1: Install all prerequisites"
- [ ] Speaker Bio/Picture
- [ ] Powerpoint
- [ ] Lab Guide
- [ ] ICE Package
	- [ ] Cloud labs configuration
- [ ] Have your lab validated and tested by multiple other people and record their names here.
	- [ ] 1st Validation: 
	- [ ] 2nd Validation: 
	- [ ] 3rd Validation: 

### Guidelines
- Must fit within a 100-minute session
	- 10 mins for Intro
	- 10 mins for Q&A + wrap-up
- If you can do your lab in 30 mins, triple it for audience time. 
- If there’s something you want to include but don’t think the majority of attendees will be able to get to, make it a challenge lab. That way they have the material and can come back to it later on.
- Many companies block short links so don’t rely on bitly or other short linking. You should be providing a list of necessary links along with the lab setup or post them to the community somewhere. A GitHub repository is a good example.

### Steps to craft a Lab
- [ ] Create rules for lab images & Capture images
	- [ ] Standardize on:
		- [ ] colors, borders, whether to use boxes or ovals, arrow color, arrow direction, image size
- [ ] Review guidebook.md over on [Guidebook Template - Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/ServiceNowEvents/GuidebookTemplate)
- [ ] First Draft of Lab Guidebook
	- [ ] Validation 1: Have someone peer review
- [ ] First Draft of PPT presentation
- [ ] Second Draft of Lab Guidebook 
- [ ] Check all your images again and make sure there are no gifs
	- [ ]  Validation 2: Have someone peer review
- [ ] Get ready to record 
	- [ ] 80% Complete on guide book
	- [ ] 100% Complete on PPT presentation
	- [ ] Know what all the gotchas are
	- [ ] Know what your sections are
- [ ] Final Guidebook Draft 
	- [ ] Validation 3: Have someone peer review
- [ ] Final ICE Package 

### Prep For Knowledge
- [ ] Be clear on requirements for Gurus
	- [ ] It's very possible that this will be the first time most of your gurus are actually seeing this technology and they are most likely not going to do a lot of pre-work beforehand outside of running the lab if you're lucky - so plan accordingly!
- [ ] Communicate with Gurus (The guru "Go before you go" meeting covers a lot of this)
	- [ ] Appoint head guru
	- [ ] Tell them to go through the Lab
		- [ ] Lab Validation 4
	- [ ] Tell them expectations on how you'd like them to interact with people in the room
		- [ ] How to act as humans in the room
		- [ ] When and how they can interrupt you
		- [ ] Take pictures of URLs on slides so they can share them with people who miss them
	- [ ] Schedule a meeting prior to knowledge 
	- [ ] Ask them to show up 15 minutes before the knowledge session
	- [ ] Send as an Email

### Guidebook Outline
1. Setup (if applicable)
	1. Github
		1. Make sure they have Github account
		2. Walk them through cloning repo, etc
		3. Explain how the checkpoints will work
	2. Github Companion (if working, if not you can just use the regular repo functions)
		1. At end of each section in lab you can add - "Didn't make it? Go to studio and change to branch X"
2. Goals
3. (CONTENT GO HERE)
4. Troubleshooting section
5. THE END

### Suggestions
- Challenges at the end of each section
	- A challenge is anything that is important that doesn't fit for time
	- Don't necessarily need to include step-by-step instructions
	- Make sure that anything you include as a challenge isn’t necessary to complete the next exercise.
